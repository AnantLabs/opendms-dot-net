ClientTesting.Ping attaches its progress reporting event to the OpenDMS.ClientLibrary.Client

OpenDMS.ClientLibrary.Client attaches the progress reporting event from ClientTesting.Ping to the OpenDMS.Networking.Http.Client

OpenDMS.Networking.Http.Client calls OpenDMS.Networking.Http.ConnectionManager

OpenDMS.Networking.Http.ConnectionManager creates a OpenDMS.Networking.Http.Connection
OpenDMS.Networking.Http.ConnectionManager attaches an OnConnect event handler to the OpenDMS.Networking.Http.Connection
OpenDMS.Networking.Http.ConnectionManager calls the OpenDMS.Networking.Http.Connection.ConnectAsync method

OpenDMS.Networking.Http.Connection.ConnectAsync fires the OpenDMS.Networking.Http.ConnectionManager.Connection_OnConnect (event handler) method

OpenDMS.Networking.Http.ConnectionManager.Connection_OnConnect (event handler) then fires the OpenDMS.Networking.Http.Client.ConnectionManager_OnConnected (event handler) method
OpenDMS.Networking.Http.Client.ConnectionManager_OnConnected (event handler) method attaches the its progress event handler
	(called Connection_OnProgress) to the OpenDMS.Networking.Http.Connection

OpenDMS.Networking.Http.Client then sends the request.
