x Bug Fix
- Informational or improvement
+ New Feature

r17
+ Added the Common.CouchDB namespace and all code therein
- Changed the framework from .NET 2.0 to .NET 4.0 - this might cause problems with Mono support.  Currently they show System.Web.Script.Serialization.JavaScriptSerializer.ConvertToType and Deserialize as "Missing".  Thus, if it is not supported before release, an alternative serialization/deserialization engine will need to be created for JSON.

r16
+ Added support for saving of meta and data assets within the transaction framework

r15
+ Added a few more methods and changed some methods to support implementation of the transaction system

- Code comments added to Common
- Code documentation generated for Common
- Removed NetworkPackage/ResourceLock.cs, NetworkPackage/Server.cs, NetworkPackage/User.cs, SerializableDictionary.cs, SerializableStringList.cs because they are not used in the project.

r4
+ Added the NetworkPackage.MetaForm and MetaFormProperty as well as code in other methods to allow their function.  Property is just a 'field' of a MetaForm.  MetaForm is provides a description of the Data.MetaAsset so that it can be managed in clients.  This will be what allows system admins to define their own properties.
